## Overview
Developed in Spring 2011 for USC's Embedded System Design (EE445) course.

Designed an electronic wristband device using the Freescale MC908JL15 microcontroller to prevent children from drowning in home swimming pools. Built prototype on wire-wrapped board with a water-detection sensor, wireless RF transceiver, graphic LCD, voltage regulators, battery monitor. Programmed in embedded C for interrupt-driven I/O, SPI protocol “bit banging”, and RF communication with a base station.
